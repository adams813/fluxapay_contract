# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Issue #394**: Multi-token support — added `set_usdc_token` function to configure a default settlement token and auto-whitelist it; `settle_payment` now supports per-payment token overrides via `payment.token_address`.
- **Issue #413**: Multi-currency invoicing for payment links — added `fiat: Option<FiatConfig>` to `create_link` with `FiatConfig { amount, currency, oracle }` and `MaybeFiatConfig` Soroban-compatible wrapper; `use_link` resolves the USDC equivalent via the FX oracle at exchange time.
- **Issue #395**: Contract upgrade mechanism — added `upgrade` function to `FXOracle`, `MerchantRegistry`, and `PaymentLinkManager` with admin authorization and `CONTRACT/UPGRADED` event emission; enhanced `RefundManager::upgrade_contract` with version tracking and event emission.
- **Issue #406**: Fixed rate-limit window bypass — changed `enforce_create_payment_rate_limit` and related functions from a sliding-window to a fixed-window strategy anchored to the first payment in the window, preventing burst-burst boundary bypass.
- **Issue #399** — Idempotency key TTL: `DataKey::IdempotencyKey` entries are now stored with a TTL derived from the payment expiry window (ledgers ≈ `(expires_at − now) / 5`, minimum `SHORT_LIVE_TTL`) instead of the permanent `LONG_LIVE_TTL`. A new reverse-map key `DataKey::PaymentIdempotencyToken(payment_id)` is also stored so `cancel_payment` and `expire_payment` can proactively remove the forward key, freeing the `client_token` for reuse immediately after a payment is cancelled or expired.
- **Issue #398** — `MerchantRegistry::transfer_admin(current_admin, new_admin)`: allows the current admin to hand off registry ownership atomically. Validates stored admin matches `current_admin`, updates `MerchantDataKey::Admin`, and emits `MERCHANT_REGISTRY/ADMIN_TRANSFERRED`. Added `get_admin()` getter. Old admin loses all privileges immediately after transfer.
- **Issue #397** — Stellar memo type validation in `create_payment`: `memo_type` must be one of `Text`, `Id`, `Hash`, or `Return`; Text memos are rejected if > 28 bytes; Id memos are rejected if not a valid `u64` decimal string. New error codes: `InvalidMemoType = 50`, `MemoTooLong = 51`, `InvalidMemoId = 52`. Validation is a no-op when `memo_type` is `None`.
- **Issue #396** — `get_merchant_payments_full(merchant_id, offset, limit) -> Vec<PaymentCharge>`: paginated getter returning full `PaymentCharge` structs (not just IDs) with `limit` silently capped at 50. Added `get_merchant_payment_count_for_dashboard(merchant_id) -> u32` for pagination UI total-count queries. Empty result (not error) when `offset` exceeds count.

### Storage key layout changes (Issue #399)
- **New key**: `DataKey::PaymentIdempotencyToken(String)` — reverse map from `payment_id` → `client_token`; stored and removed alongside `DataKey::IdempotencyKey`. Existing `IdempotencyKey` entries written by prior contract versions carry `LONG_LIVE_TTL` and will naturally expire; new entries use payment-scoped TTLs.
- `allow_token` unauthorized non-admin test for token allowlist enforcement (closes #328)
- `settle_payment` tests for unauthorized operators, pending/expired rejection, and `PAYMENT/SETTLED` event emission (closes #326)
- `get_merchant_payments_paginated` optional `status_filter` parameter to paginate merchant payments by `PaymentStatus` (closes #280)
- `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh`: builds all contract WASMs and deploys them to the configured Stellar network; writes resulting contract IDs to `.env.testnet`; fails fast if `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` or `STELLAR_NETWORK` are unset (closes #294)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: CLI recipe sections for `create_refund`, `process_refund`, `create_dispute`, `set_dispute_deadline`, `resolve_dispute_with_refund`, `verify_payment`, `settle_payment`, `set_paused`, `set_rate`, `create_link`, and `use_link` — each with full command, expected output, and error scenarios (closes #299)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: Deployment section documenting how to run `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` and load `.env.testnet`

- `check_dispute_deadline(dispute_id)`: public callable to trigger escalation when a dispute review deadline has elapsed; emits `DISPUTE/ESCALATED` and is a no-op if not passed/already escalated/resolved (closes #306)
- `top_up_stream(stream_id, amount)`: allows a sender to top up a single stream via direct token transfer; credits the stream deposit and emits `STREAM/TOPPED_UP` (closes #305)
- Treasury accounting: refund-time fees now accumulate in `DataKey::TreasuryBalance`; adds `get_treasury_balance()` and `withdraw_treasury(admin, amount, destination)` for admin withdrawals; emits `TREASURY/WITHDRAWN` and introduces `Error::InsufficientTreasuryBalance` (closes #291)
- `create_payments_batch`: atomic batch payment creation API with a maximum batch size of 50 and per-merchant batch rate-limit enforcement; returns payment IDs in order and emits `PAYMENT/CREATED` for each payment (closes #293)

- AccessControl edge-case tests: `renounce_role` idempotency for non-holders, self-role removal, and unauthorized `transfer_admin` validation (closes #337)
- FXOracle role management tests: `oracle_grant_role` by admin/non-admin authorization, `oracle_has_role` verification, and `get_fx_admin` initialized/uninitialized states (closes #335)
- MerchantRegistry pagination tests: `get_all_merchants` offset-based edge cases including beyond-range offsets and zero-limit handling (closes #337)
- PaymentStreaming batch operation tests: `top_up_multiple_streams` authorization and deposit updates, `cancel_multiple_streams` atomicity with invalid IDs, `batch_withdraw_to` multi-destination routing and zero-accrued stream handling (closes #336)
- PaymentLinkManager batch verification tests: `verify_batch` coverage for active/missing/deactivated links and empty input handling (closes #334)

### Changed
- **Issue #394**: `create_link` now accepts 10 parameters (fiat params bundled into `FiatConfig`); `PaymentLink` struct stores `fiat: MaybeFiatConfig`; existing `create_link` and `use_link` signatures updated accordingly.
- **All contracts**: Added `CONTRACT/UPGRADED` event emission pattern for upgradeability.

## Contract Versions

Each contract exposes a `version() -> u32` function. Bump this value whenever a storage key or struct layout changes in a breaking way.

| Contract            | Current Version |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `PaymentProcessor`  | 1               |
| `RefundManager`     | 1               |
| `FXOracle`          | 1               |
| `PaymentLinkManager`| 1               |
| `MerchantRegistry`  | 1               |

## Upgrade Checklist

When deploying a new contract version:

1. **Read old state** — call `get_payment`, `get_refund`, etc. on the live contract and confirm structs deserialise correctly with the new code before upgrading.
2. **Bump `version()`** — increment the constant in the relevant `impl` block.
3. **Migrate if needed** — if a `#[contracttype]` struct gains or loses fields, write a one-shot migration entry-point that reads the old layout and rewrites under the new key/struct before the upgrade goes live.
4. **Update this file** — add a new `## v<N>` section documenting every changed key, struct field, or event signature.
5. **Test** — run `cargo test --all-features` and the bounded property tests locally before opening a PR.
