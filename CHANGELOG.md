# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh`: builds all contract WASMs and deploys them to the configured Stellar network; writes resulting contract IDs to `.env.testnet`; fails fast if `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` or `STELLAR_NETWORK` are unset (closes #294)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: CLI recipe sections for `create_refund`, `process_refund`, `create_dispute`, `set_dispute_deadline`, `resolve_dispute_with_refund`, `verify_payment`, `settle_payment`, `set_paused`, `set_rate`, `create_link`, and `use_link` — each with full command, expected output, and error scenarios (closes #299)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: Deployment section documenting how to run `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` and load `.env.testnet`

- `check_dispute_deadline(dispute_id)`: public callable to trigger escalation when a dispute review deadline has elapsed; emits `DISPUTE/ESCALATED` and is a no-op if not passed/already escalated/resolved (closes #306)
- `top_up_stream(stream_id, amount)`: allows a sender to top up a single stream via direct token transfer; credits the stream deposit and emits `STREAM/TOPPED_UP` (closes #305)
- Treasury accounting: refund-time fees now accumulate in `DataKey::TreasuryBalance`; adds `get_treasury_balance()` and `withdraw_treasury(admin, amount, destination)` for admin withdrawals; emits `TREASURY/WITHDRAWN` and introduces `Error::InsufficientTreasuryBalance` (closes #291)
- `create_payments_batch`: atomic batch payment creation API with a maximum batch size of 50 and per-merchant batch rate-limit enforcement; returns payment IDs in order and emits `PAYMENT/CREATED` for each payment (closes #293)

- AccessControl edge-case tests: `renounce_role` idempotency for non-holders, self-role removal, and unauthorized `transfer_admin` validation (closes #337)
- FXOracle role management tests: `oracle_grant_role` by admin/non-admin authorization, `oracle_has_role` verification, and `get_fx_admin` initialized/uninitialized states (closes #335)
- MerchantRegistry pagination tests: `get_all_merchants` offset-based edge cases including beyond-range offsets and zero-limit handling (closes #337)
- PaymentStreaming batch operation tests: `top_up_multiple_streams` authorization and deposit updates, `cancel_multiple_streams` atomicity with invalid IDs, `batch_withdraw_to` multi-destination routing and zero-accrued stream handling (closes #336)
- PaymentLinkManager batch verification tests: `verify_batch` coverage for active/missing/deactivated links and empty input handling (closes #334)

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: replaced inline build and deploy steps with a call to `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh`; exposes all four contract IDs as step outputs; uploads `.env.testnet` as a workflow artifact

## Unreleased

### Added
- Propose-and-claim admin transfers with compatibility wrappers for existing admin handoff entry points
- Payer-level payment creation rate limiting to reduce spam and abusive retries
- Automatic pending refund creation for overpaid payments
- Dispute bonding so disputes now stake a bond that is returned or collected during resolution
- Role management audit logging events: ROLE_GRANTED, ROLE_REVOKED, ADMIN_TRANSFER_PROPOSED, ADMIN_TRANSFER_COMPLETED, REVOCATION_PENDING, REVOCATION_CANCELLED, ROLE_RENOUNCED, PROPOSAL_CREATED, PROPOSAL_VOTED, RECOVERY_ADMIN_TRANSFER_PROPOSED
- 24‑hour revocation cooldown periods for critical roles (ORACLE, SETTLEMENT_OPERATOR)
- emergency_revoke_role for immediate revocation bypassing cooldown
- finalize_revocation for completing revocation after cooldown
- cancel_revocation for canceling pending revocation
- get_pending_revocation to query pending revocation status
- initialize_with_recovery and set_recovery_key for emergency recovery key management
- recovery_initiate_admin_transfer for recovery‑initiated admin transfer with 30‑day lock‑in
- Multi‑signature support for critical admin functions: create_proposal, vote_proposal, execute_proposal, get_proposal
- set_multisig_config to update threshold and signer list
- get_multisig_config to query current multi‑sig config

## Contract Versions

Each contract exposes a `version() -> u32` function. Bump this value whenever a storage key or struct layout changes in a breaking way.

| Contract            | Current Version |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `PaymentProcessor`  | 1               |
| `RefundManager`     | 1               |
| `FXOracle`          | 1               |
| `PaymentLinkManager`| 1               |
| `MerchantRegistry`  | 1               |

## Upgrade Checklist

When deploying a new contract version:

1. **Read old state** — call `get_payment`, `get_refund`, etc. on the live contract and confirm structs deserialise correctly with the new code before upgrading.
2. **Bump `version()`** — increment the constant in the relevant `impl` block.
3. **Migrate if needed** — if a `#[contracttype]` struct gains or loses fields, write a one-shot migration entry-point that reads the old layout and rewrites under the new key/struct before the upgrade goes live.
4. **Update this file** — add a new `## v<N>` section documenting every changed key, struct field, or event signature.
5. **Test** — run `cargo test --all-features` and the bounded property tests locally before opening a PR.
